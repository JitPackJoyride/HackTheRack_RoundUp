# HackTheRack - RoundUp
Welcome to the GitHub Repository of the Hack The Rack group "RoundUp".

We are doing Challenge 1.

Instead of only using static customer segmentation, we suggest that a succesful CRM should be dynamic in nature, pinpointing the needs of the customers at the right time. Using location tags and external data (such as facebook event, health data), we can identify where our customers are or what they will be doing. With these information, we can provide suggestions and promotions that is suitable for them. For example, using the customer's location and API from HK Oberservatory, we will be able to notify our customers to bring umbrellas or they can rent/ purchase one at our store. We can also analysis past transaction records and suggest targeted promotions to people who is going to concernts in Hung Hom. By satisfying the timely needs of our customers, not only this will increase their spending and loyalty to us (Circle K), we will also be able to provide precision marketing campaigns to our suppliers. This ecosystem of using dynamic segmentation can also be used in other retailing businesses such as Trinity and Toys R' Us.
